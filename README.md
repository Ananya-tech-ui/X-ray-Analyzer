Features
✅ Bone Segmentation: Color-coded watershed segmentation for bone structures
✅ Fracture Detection: Identifies and classifies fractures (Transverse, Oblique, Comminuted)
✅ Image Enhancement: CLAHE contrast adjustment and noise reduction
✅ Interactive UI: Upload, process, and reset with Colab-native widgets
✅ Real-Time Display: Matplotlib visualization of processed X-rays

How to Run in Google Colab
Upload an X-Ray: Click the Upload X-Ray button (supports JPG/PNG)
Enhance Image: Improve contrast with CLAHE
Reduce Noise: Apply bilateral filtering for cleaner images
Segment Bones: Highlight bones with color masks
Detect Cracks: Identify fractures with contour analysis

python
# Simply run the cell containing the XRayAnalyzer class
xray_analyzer = XRayAnalyzer()
Technical Stack
Python Libraries: OpenCV, scikit-image, SciPy, Matplotlib

Algorithms:
Watershed segmentation (skimage.segmentation)
Canny edge detection (cv2.Canny)
Adaptive thresholding (cv2.adaptiveThreshold)
Colab Integration: ipywidgets for UI, google.colab.files for uploads

Limitations
⚠ Accuracy: Dependent on X-ray quality (85-90% for clear images)
⚠ File Types: Supports only JPG/PNG (DICOM not included)
⚠ Performance: Large images may process slower in Colab
